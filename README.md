# Sudoku
This is a version of Sudoku that I created using C. 
It has some basic features and loads really slowly, but it works! 
I recommend using JetBrains Mono as the font for whatever terminal you run it in. 

It's my first time using Github to show off something I've made, so I'm not sure how any of this works. :D 

Feel free to leave some feedback if you'd like! 
I don't know how that works either. xD
